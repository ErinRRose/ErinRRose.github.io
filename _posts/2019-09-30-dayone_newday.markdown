First day of my new program, still nervous.  First time blogging. Waiting for the nerves to stop.  It feels like a big risk for someone is not very well disciplined to do self paced study.  I am starring at the bottom, I thought I had some knowledge going into this but now after one day it feels like I have none. I thought I would write my blog like a diary to start since everything is so new for me.  I hope I make some friends to talk to about all of this on here soon.  Gotta keep cracking on!
