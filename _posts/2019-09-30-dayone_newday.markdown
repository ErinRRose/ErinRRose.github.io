Woke up this morning and realized that I started college 20 years ago this fall.  20 years!  That is what this feels like again. It is starting over, it is starting anew.  
When I started college, I was 18 and moving away from home, some 6000 miles.  Hawaii to Maryland came as a shock to the system.  Season changes and new cultures colored my first year, and independence.  THere was no one to remind me to do my homework or go to class and soon my grades suffered.  I loved learning I love the process when it interested me but I had a lot to learn about being a decated student.  **

Years later in grad school bad habits remained, I avoided the tasks I found uninteresting or undesireable.  Time helps.

It has been 20 years and I get to start anew, and everything I am learning is so new that I can't pick and choose what I like, I just have go through it all.  I am excited most days to tackle the work.  I still get nervous, more so in the beginning, asking for help takes some pressure off.  Has age changed me or the challenge to tackle new things.  When I study in undergrad I was generally engaged in the course work, but felt slowed by the pace of it all.  I am enrolled now in self-paced, which helps with my schedule, which can be chaotic with a 2.5 year old.  But the self-paced has a opened a new avenue that I did not even realize I can go fast or slow.  Sure I thought going at my own pace with be great, but I didn't think about it's impact on my interest and learning.  

Last week, I had to take a step back from school for a few days as my child was ill.  I was frustrated and worried I would lose focus and traction.  Turns out it helped me attune to the process.  Most days I still get nervous but I also feel more ready to conquer!  I stop and ask for help, something that made uncomfortable, but I realized I had to get comfortable asking for help, with as much as we have going in here and doing it solo means I need to talk to others.  

This process is so foreign to me, learn at my own pace, working on my own time, sharing my feelings and thoughts in this way, asking for help.  I have trained myseld to be a private person especially on the internet.  This blog turns all of that on its head.  So here's to you and me doing it, however we do it!
