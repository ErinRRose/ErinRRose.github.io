I just keep trying things and hoping they stick! I feel a little lost most days but the feeling is getting smaller as I gain more knowledge.  I find myself stuck mostly in I have no idea how to do what its' asking for, I get the lab and I know what it's looking for but my brain goes nope.  Hopefully with time and cramming more stuff in there, it will start to come out of there easier.
