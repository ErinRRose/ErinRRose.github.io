There is a long standing belief that we use right or left sides of our brain separately, but we are learning more about the brain each day.  More recently it is said that most things we do use both sides, albeit not equally every time, it used both.  Language is said to primarily come from the left side of the brain.  It takes in the information and helps form the new words to speak the language.  I have often said, learning to code is like learning another language for me.  Coincidentally I never really learned and master a second language nor have I done any coding work before.  

I spend a lot of thinking if I have the right skill set to learn and complete competently this program.  Maybe it's because I struggled so much as a young person to learn a second language, maybe it comes to self doubt or perhaps it simply the way I learn.  Researchers are learning more about humans and how our brains work everyday.  Years ago it was believed that logic was present in the left side of the brain and emotion and creativity stemmed from the right.  Today we now that do most things we use both.  Except in the area of LANGUAGE and ATTENTION.  Those who study the brain believe that Broca's and Wernicke's areas are largely in charge of language comprehension.  But some believe that attention, specifically sustained attention comes from the right hemisphere.  

It can feel like my sides are in conflict or at least not speaking to each other at times. Learning to code, is like learning a language which is a skill I did not master but once.  I have often wished I had learned and dedicated myself to keeping another language.  Learning another language beyond your native language can be more complex than simply learning to code as you need to take in the words then learn to speak them.  For me that has been the difficult part actually speaking it.  With code you do need able to speak about what you know and how you got there, but another language requires taking in the information and then putting it back out in another way.  Much like the computer, we process.  

But we as humans have limited focus and attention unlike computers, and sleep, diet, activity around can all affect our attention.  We are a society of short focus and we have lots of things that require our focus.  We train ourselves to stay on task and concentrate.  But learning to code is using a lot of our special brain functions to achieve this goal.  Think about that the next time you learn something new.
